1) Drosophila Melanogaster (dm3)
2) Pax
3) Genomic Location: "chr2L:19404129"; Target Sequence: "GAGGGATTCCATGAGCGTGACGG"
4) Left Primer Coordinates: "chr2L:19404264-19404286" Left Primer: "ACTACCACAATCTGTTCAGCCC"
   Right Primer Coordinates: "chr2L:19404039-19404061" Right Primer: "GCCGAGATGTAGTTCTCCATAA"
5) Pax genes help to control how the bodys develop; If these genes are
   knocked out the fly might have shorter legs, its wings would be 
   smaller or missing, and it could have changes in the way its head
   and eyes look.
